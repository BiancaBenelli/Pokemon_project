This is a project about Pokemons for my Programming course, made up of four files:

|                      |                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| pokemon.csv          | Csv of the dataframe                       |
| clean_dataset.py     | Python file where the dataframe is cleaned |
| Pokemon.ipynb        | Jupyter Notebook for Visual Studio         |
| pokemon_streamlit.py | Streamlit of the project                   |
| Pokemon_Colab.ipynb  | Copy of the Colab file                     |

The Colab file is the one with all the comments and plots etc.
The reasoning behind the cleaning is not in the clean_dataset.py file, but in the Colab one. I used it to import the clean dataframe directly in the Streamlit e Jupyter file (so that the code could be clearer, focusing only on the plots and models)
